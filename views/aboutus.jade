    p We succeed in the best interests of our clients”. I have updated this.

    p  Since 1995 I have been fascinated by Real Estate. Upon leaving school like many others entering the real world for the first time, I had no money, no experience and no real direction, however I knew Real Estate investing was my calling and helping others my desire.

For over 18 years, I’ve immersed myself in all things Real Estate, trying our hand at many different strategies and ways to develop a multi-million dollar real estate portfolio.
